# Facial Expression Detection with TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates facial expression detection using TensorFlow.js. The application captures video from your webcam and uses a pre-trained model to identify the user's current emotion.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- A web browser that supports TensorFlow.js (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Instructions

1. **Download the Project**: Clone or download this repository.
2. **Open index.html**: Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. **Grant Camera Access**: Allow the browser access to your webcam.
4. **View Results**: The browser will display a live video feed and the detected emotion below the video.

## Model Training

This project utilizes a pre-trained model for facial expression recognition.  The model has been trained on a dataset of facial images labeled with different emotions. 

## Customization

- **Model**: You can replace the pre-trained model with a custom model. Ensure that the model architecture and input/output shapes are compatible with the provided code.
- **UI**: You can customize the HTML and CSS to design your own interface.
- **Features**: You can add additional features, such as:
    - Real-time emotion visualization (e.g., displaying a graphical representation of the detected emotion).
    - Data logging and analysis (e.g., storing the detected emotions and analyzing patterns).

## Docker Setup (Optional)

To easily deploy and run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t facial-expression-detector .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 facial-expression-detector
   ```
3. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`.

## Notes

* The accuracy of the facial expression detection depends on factors such as lighting, image quality, and the diversity of the training data.
* TensorFlow.js provides a wide range of tools and resources for building and deploying machine learning models in web browsers.
